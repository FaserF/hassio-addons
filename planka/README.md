Planka for Homeassistant OS

## About

Elegant open source project tracking.

## Installation

[![FaserF Homeassistant Addons](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFaserF%2Fhassio-addons)
<br />
The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br />
Just click the link above or add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons>

Please ensure that the MariaDB Addon is installed!

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
ssl: true
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface. Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

If you need a self-signed certificate, have a look at my openssl addon: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/tree/master/openssl>

**Note**: _The files MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

## Ingress

This addon currently does not fully support ingress! Hopefully that will come soon.

## Support

Got questions or problems?

You can [open an issue here][issue] GitHub.
Please keep in mind, that this software is only tested on amd64.
