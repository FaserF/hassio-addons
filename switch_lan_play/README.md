Nintendo Switch LAN-Play Client for Homeassistant OS

![The Lan-Play Home Home Assistant Add-on](../_images/switch_lan_play/screenshot.png)

## About

To play with your CFW Nintendo Switch online, you can use this addon + a public or private Server. This addon can be used, to stop running the lan play client on a Desktop PC/Laptop.
This is just the Client Software and NOT the Server Sotware. To use a lan-play server with Homeassistant OS, please have a look at my other addon: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/switch_lan_play_server>

This docker image will self-compile the latest lan-play software and run it based on your architecture. More information can be found here: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A_4o8HCAfDBFsePcGL3utG-LfzMUovcx/view>
The first installation can take up to 10 minutes because of this! Depending on your hardware.
