#### Important Information

- **Edge Branch (Beta)**: A new `edge` branch is now available for those who want to test the latest features and improvements before they are released to the stable channel.
- **Unsupported Branch**: A new `unsupported` branch has been created for add-ons that no longer receive direct manual support. These add-ons are still maintained but may have limited support compared to the main add-ons.
