All addons have been unified, updated, and many bugs have been fixed. Many addons have been partially or completely rewritten to improve stability, performance, and maintainability.

#### Important Information

- **Edge Branch (Beta)**: A new `edge` branch is now available for those who want to test the latest features and improvements before they are released to the stable channel.
- **Unsupported Branch**: A new `unsupported` branch has been created for addons that no longer receive direct manual support. These addons are still maintained but may have limited support compared to the main addons.

This release represents a significant effort to standardize and improve all addons in the repository.
