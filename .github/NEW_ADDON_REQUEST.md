# New Add-on Requests

## Policy

Thank you for your interest in FaserF's Home Assistant Add-ons!

**I do not accept requests for new add-ons.**

I only add add-ons to this repository that I personally use and maintain. This ensures that:

- 🔧 **Quality**: Every add-on gets proper attention and maintenance
- 🏠 **Real-world testing**: All add-ons are tested in my own Home Assistant environment
- ⏱️ **Sustainability**: I can realistically maintain all add-ons long-term

## What You Can Do Instead

### 🌟 Feature Requests for Existing Add-ons

If you have ideas to improve an **existing** add-on, please [open a Feature Request](https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)!
I'm happy to consider enhancements that benefit users.

### 🐛 Bug Reports

Found a bug? Please [report it](https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) so I can fix it!

### 🛠️ Create Your Own Add-on
