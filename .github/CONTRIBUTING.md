## Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe
you'd like a new feature? You can help us by submitting an issue to our
[GitHub Repository][github]. Before you create an issue, make sure you search
the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

Even better: You could submit a pull request with a fix / new feature!

## Pull request process

1. Search our repository for open or closed [pull requests][prs] that relates
   to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

1. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of two other
   developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request
   the second reviewer to merge it for you.
