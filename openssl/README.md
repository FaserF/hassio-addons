OpenSSL - Self signed certificates for Homeassistant OS

## About

OpenSSL is a software library for applications that secure communications over computer networks against eavesdropping or need to identify the party at the other end. It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.

OpenSSL contains an open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols. The core library, written in the C programming language, implements basic cryptographic functions and provides various utility functions. Wrappers allowing the use of the OpenSSL library in a variety of computer languages are available.

The OpenSSL Software Foundation (OSF) represents the OpenSSL project in most legal capacities including contributor license agreements, managing donations, and so on. OpenSSL Software Services (OSS) also represents the OpenSSL project, for Support Contracts.

## Installation

[![FaserF Homeassistant Addons](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFaserF%2Fhassio-addons)
<br />
The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br />
Just click the link above or add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons>

After starting the addon, a self signed certificate will be created and placed to:
/ssl/key_openssl.pem
/ssl/cert_openssl.pem

These can then be used by other addons, for example my apache2 webserver addon.
If the certificates are about to expire, just restart the addone once and new certificates will be created.
WARNING: After restarting the addon, old certificates named as above will be deleted and overwritten!

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
website_name: mywebsite.ddns.net
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `website_name`

This option is needed. This will be the website name for the self signed certificate.

## Support
