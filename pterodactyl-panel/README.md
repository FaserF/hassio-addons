pterodactyl Panel Gameserver for Homeassistant OS

## About

WARNING: Currently only limited working. Right now it can be considered beta and unstable. Don't blame me if your gameservers would be lost etc.

PterodactylÂ® is a free, open-source game server management panel built with PHP, React, and Go. Designed with security in mind, Pterodactyl runs all game servers in isolated Docker containers while exposing a beautiful and intuitive UI to end users.<br />
Stop settling for less. Make game servers a first class citizen on your platform.

## Installation

[![FaserF Homeassistant Addons](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFaserF%2Fhassio-addons)
<br />
The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br />
Just click the link above or add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons>

## Configuration

The MariaDB Integration is needed before installing this one!

Afterwards create a new user in the MariaDB Addon called "pterodactyl" with full permissions on the database "panel"

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
password: mySecretPassword
ssl: false
certfile: itdoesntmatter_as_ssl_is_set_to_false
keyfile: itdoesntmatter_as_ssl_is_set_to_false
```
<br />
Recommended Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
password: mySecretPassword
ssl: true
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `password`

This option is required. The password for the mariadb "pterodactyl" user.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface.

If you need a self-signed certificate, have a look at my openssl addon: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/tree/master/openssl>

**Note**: _The files MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `reset_database`

Enables it to reset the database files for pterodactyl. Please not this action can not be undone! Use it with care.

## Ingress

This addon will support Homeassistant Ingress. Until now it is work in progress!
