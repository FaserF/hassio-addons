All addons have been unified, updated, and many bugs have been fixed. Many addons have been partially or completely rewritten to improve stability, performance, and maintainability.

#### Important Information

- **Edge Branch (Beta)**: A new `edge` branch is now available for those who want to test the latest features and improvements before they are released to the stable channel.
- **Unsupported Branch**: A new `unsupported` branch has been created for addons that no longer receive direct manual support. These addons are still maintained but may have limited support compared to the main addons.
- **Bug Reports**: If you encounter any new issues, please report them on GitHub as usual. Your feedback helps us improve the addons.

This release represents a significant effort to standardize and improve all addons in the repository.
