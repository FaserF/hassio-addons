## About

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.<br />
The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") was launched in 1995 and it has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996. It has celebrated its 25th birthday as a project in February 2020.<br />
The Apache HTTP Server is a project of The Apache Software Foundation.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
document_root: /media/apache2
php_ini: /share/apache2/php.ini
default_conf: /share/apache2/000-default.conf
default_ssl_conf: get_file
website_name: itdoesntmatter_as_ssl_is_set_to_false
username: apache
password: mySecretPassword
ssl: false
certfile: itdoesntmatter_as_ssl_is_set_to_false
keyfile: itdoesntmatter_as_ssl_is_set_to_false
```
<br />
Recommended Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
document_root: /share/htdocs
php_ini: default
default_conf: default
default_ssl_conf: default
website_name: mywebsite.ddns.net
ssl: true
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `document_root`

This option is needed. Change it depending where your root webfolder is on your homeassistant installation.

Note: it has to be somewhere in the /share or /media folder! Other folders are not visible to this addon.

### Option: `php_ini`

You can choose between the following options:

default -> the default php81 php.ini file will be used

get_file -> copies the default php81 php.ini file from the addon to /share/apache2addon_php.ini

path/to/your/new/php.ini -> Please change the location depending where your custom php.ini file is, f.e.: /share/apache2/php.ini

### Option: `default_conf` & `default_ssl_conf`

You can choose between the following options:

default -> the default apache2 addon file will be used

get_config -> Get a copy of the default apache2 addon config file to your /share folder.

path/to/your/new/apache2.conf -> Please change the location depending where your custom 000-default.conf / 000-default-le-ssl.conf file is, f.e.: /share/apache2/000-default.conf <br />
More Information: <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HTTPD/ExampleVhosts><br /> <br />
Please note, that I wont give any support if you are using custom apache2 config files and are receiving any apache2 errors!

### Option: `website_name`

This option is needed, if you enable ssl to true. If you are not using SSL put anything in here, as it doesnt matter.

### Option: `username`

This option is optional. This user is for accessing web files (NOT the website itself). It will change the owner of all web files from "root" to this new owner.

This is NOT used for authentification for your website. If you want this have a look at [Authentification for your website](#Authentification-for-your-website)

### Option: `password`

This option is optional. Some self hosted web sites require an authentification password to access files within the docker image. #50

This is NOT used for authentification for your website. If you want this have a look at [Authentification for your website](#Authentification-for-your-website)

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface. Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

If you need a self-signed certificate, have a look at my openssl addon: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/tree/master/openssl>

**Note**: _The files MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

## Authentification for your website
Use a .htaccess file in combination with a .htpasswd file for this: <https://www.htaccessredirect.net/>

Example .htaccess file:

```bash
AuthType Basic
AuthName "My Webserver Authentification"
AuthUserFile /share/.htpasswd
Require valid-user
```

## Ingress

This addon supports Homeassistant Ingress. Until now it seems only to work if you enable SSL!
And also I am sorry, but I cant support all your websites. Basic HTML Websites will work great with ingress, the more advanced the page is, the harder it is to support ingress.

## Support
