Bash Script Executer for Homeassistant OS

## About

This is a simple Docker Image to execute personal scripts. The reason I am needing this, is that the HA OS has limited features installed (for example no curl, sed etc) and this Addon fixes that issue.<br />
You can run up to three different scripts with this addon.<br />
This docker image comes with: busybox-extras curl grep coreutils sed xmlstarlet

## Installation

[![FaserF Homeassistant Addons](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFaserF%2Fhassio-addons)
<br />
The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br />
Just click the link above or add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons>

Put your scripts somewhere in the /share/ folder. Other folders are not visible to this addon.<br />
Example File where your script could be: /share/scripts/script.sh

## Configuration

**I am recommending to disable "Start on boot" and the Watchdog option from HA for this addon!**<br />

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
script_path: /share/scripts/script.sh
script_argument1: myFirstArgument
script_argument2: AnotherVariable
script_argument3: AnotherVariable
script_path2: false
script2_argument1:
script2_argument2:
script2_argument3:
script_path3: false
script3_argument2:
script3_argument2:
script3_argument3:
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `script_path`

This option is needed. Change it depending where your script is or change it to "false" to leave it empty.

### Option: `scriptX_argumentX`

This option is optional. You can submit up to three arguments to your script with this option.

### Option: `script_path2`

This option is needed. Change it depending where your script is or change it to "false" to leave it empty.

### Option: `script_path3`

This option is needed. Change it depending where your script is or change it to "false" to leave it empty.

## Cron Support - running scripts by time

I havent implemented Cron in this addon, as you can run your scripts periodically by an Homeassistant automation.
Example Automation: <br />

```yaml
  - alias: "Run Bash Script with Addon Bash Script Executer"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: '00:02:00'
      - platform: time_pattern
        minutes: '/90'
        seconds: 0
    action:
      - service: hassio.addon_start
        data:
          addon: 605cee21_bashscriptexecuter
```

## Support

Got questions or problems?

You can [open an issue here][issue] GitHub.
Please keep in mind, that this software is only tested on armv7 running on a Raspberry Pi 4. And that I have made this addon for my personal scripts.
