Netboot.xyz PXE Server for Homeassistant OS

## About

netboot.xyz is a way to PXE boot various operating system installers or utilities from one place within the BIOS without the need of having to go retrieve the media to run the tool. iPXE is used to provide a user friendly menu from within the BIOS that lets you easily choose the operating system you want along with any specific types of versions or bootable flags.

You can remote attach the ISO to servers, set it up as a rescue option in Grub, or even set up your home network to boot to it by default so that itâ€™s always available.

## Installation

[![FaserF Homeassistant Addons](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFaserF%2Fhassio-addons)
<br />
The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br />
Just click the link above or add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons>

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
path: /media/netboot/image
path_config: /media/netboot/config
dhcp_range: 192.168.178.200
```
<br />

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `path`

This option is needed. Change it depending where your ISO files and more are.

Note: it has to be somewhere in the /media folder! Other folders are not visible to this addon.

### Option: `path_config`

This option is needed. Change it depending where your netboot.xyz config files and more are.

Note: it has to be somewhere in the /media folder! Other folders are not visible to this addon.

### Option: `dhcp_range`

This option is needed. Change it depending to your network. Try using a higher IP in the last range (f.e. 100 or 200)

## Ingress

This addon supports Homeassistant Ingress. But it seems to be buggy.

## Post-Installation
Before booting for the first time, I recommend having a look at the netboot config.<br />
Go to <http://YOUR-HOMEASSISTANT-IP:3000> -> Menus -> boot.cfg<br />

### Windows
1. Change the following line depending to your WinPE location: <br />
   set win_base_url <http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:PortForTheNGINXserver/WinPE> <br />

   example if you are hosting your extracted files directly on the netboot.xyz server and your IP address is 192.168.178.2: <br />
   set win_base_url <http://192.168.178.2:85/WinPE> <br />

2. Copy the windows PE files to your $path folder -> WinPE -> x64<br />
   Example: /media/netboot/image/WinPE/x64<br />

3. Extract the windows ISO and Copy the files anywhere to your $path folder, for example:<br />
   /media/netboot/image/windows<br />

4. Install the Samba Share Homeassistant Addon & Start it<br />
   Needed for providing the win10 ISO to the winPE<br />

5. Enter the following line after booting the WinPE<br />
net use Z: \ \YOUR-SERVER-IP\$path /user:YOUR-SERVER-IP\mySambaUser myPassword<br />
net use Z: \ \192.168.178.2\media\netboot\image\windows /user:192.168.178.2\mySambaUser myPassword<br />
Z:\setup.exe <br />

### Automate this Windows Installation Process

Modify your WinPE:<br />
1. Create a Main.cmd file at your WinPE location in a new folder "Scripts" <br />
   f.e. /media/netboot/image/WinPE/x64/Scripts/Start.cmd<br />
   Then add the two lines from above into that script<br />
   Then modify the wpeinit to use that script.
2. Create an autounattend.xml file. You can find some examples from me here: <https://github.com/FaserF/WindowsPostInstaller/tree/master/autounattend><br />

## Support

Got questions or problems?

You can [open an issue here][issue] GitHub.
Please keep in mind, that this software is only tested on armv7 running on a Raspberry Pi 4.

### Known issues
1. Directly after the PXE boot the boot will run into multiple timeouts if you wont configure PXE DHCP options in your router's settings<br />
2. Changes to boot.cfg seem to be ignored by netboot.xyz . It will always use the default config. <https://github.com/netbootxyz/netboot.xyz/discussions/861> <br />
