# Switch LAN Play Server Documentation

Nintendo Switch LAN-Play Server for Homeassistant OS

To play with your CFW Nintendo Switch online, you can use this addon + a public or private Server. This addon can be used, to stop running the lan play client on a Desktop PC/Laptop.

This is just the Server Software and NOT the Client Software. To use a lan-play client with Homeassistant OS, please have a look at my other addon: [switch_lan_play](https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/switch_lan_play)

This docker image will self-compile the latest lan-play software and run it based on your architecture. More information can be found here: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A_4o8HCAfDBFsePcGL3utG-LfzMUovcx/view>

The first start can take up to 10 minutes because of this! Depending on your hardware.
