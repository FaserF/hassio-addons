Nintendo Switch LAN-Play Server for Homeassistant OS

## About

To play with your CFW Nintendo Switch online, you can use this addon + a public or private Server. This addon can be used, to stop running the lan play client on a Desktop PC/Laptop.
This is just the Server Software and NOT the Client Sotware. To use a lan-play client with Homeassistant OS, please have a look at my other addon: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/switch_lan_play>

This docker image will self-compile the latest lan-play software and run it based on your architecture. More information can be found here: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A_4o8HCAfDBFsePcGL3utG-LfzMUovcx/view>
The first start can take up to 10 minutes because of this! Depending on your hardware.

## Installation

[![FaserF Homeassistant Addons](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFaserF%2Fhassio-addons)
<br />
The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br />
Just click the link above or add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons>

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
username: mysecretuser
password: mysecretpw
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `username`

This option is optional. If you wont set up a username, no authentification will be used to connect to your server.

### Option: `password`

This option is optional. If you wont set up a password, no authentification will be used to connect to your server.

**Note**: If you leave this empty there will be issues.

## Homeassistant Sensor
To get a HA Sensor with the current count of people online and a attribute of the server version on your server, add the following in your configuration.yaml

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: Switch LAN-Play Online
    resource: http://{YOUR_SERVER_IP}:11451/info
    method: GET
    unit_of_measurement: people
    json_attributes:

    value_template: "{{value_json.online}}"
```
