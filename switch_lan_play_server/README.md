## 📖 About

Nintendo Switch LAN-Play Server for Homeassistant OS

To play with your CFW Nintendo Switch online, you can use this addon + a public
or private Server. This addon can be used, to stop running the lan play client
on a Desktop PC/Laptop.

This is just the Server Software and NOT the Client Sotware. To use a lan-play
client with Homeassistant OS, please have a look at my other addon:
<https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/switch_lan_play>

This docker image will self-compile the latest lan-play software and run it
based on your architecture. More information can be found here:
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A_4o8HCAfDBFsePcGL3utG-LfzMUovcx/view>

The first start can take up to 10 minutes because of this! Depending on your hardware.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.

Just click the link above or add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: <https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons>
