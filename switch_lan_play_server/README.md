## 📖 About

Nintendo Switch LAN-Play Server for Homeassistant OS

To play with your CFW Nintendo Switch online, you can use this addon + a public or private Server. This addon can be used, to stop running the lan play client on a Desktop PC/Laptop.

This is just the Server Software and NOT the Client Software. To use a lan-play client with Homeassistant OS, please have a look at my other addon: [switch_lan_play](https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/switch_lan_play)

> [!NOTE]
> The first start can take up to 10 minutes because the docker image will self-compile the latest lan-play software based on your architecture.
