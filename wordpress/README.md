## 📖 About

The most popular publication platform on the Web.

WordPress is open-source software you can use to create a beautiful website, blog, or app.

This app brings Wordpress to Home Assistant, allowing you to host your own website directly
on your Home Assistant instance.

## 🌐 How to Access

The app exposes two ports for accessing your WordPress site:

- **HTTP**: Port `8099` => `http://homeassistant.local:8099`
- **HTTPS**: Port `8449` => `https://homeassistant.local:8449`

**Important**:

1. If you enable **SSL** (`ssl: true`), requests to the HTTP port will strictly redirect to the HTTPS port.
2. Make sure your `wordpress_url` configuration matches the protocol you intend to use (e.g., start with `https://` if using SSL).

## 🔐 First Run & Login

### Initial Credentials

On the **very first startup**, the app will install WordPress and automatically generate a secure **Admin Password**.

1. Start the app.
2. Check the **Log** tab of the app immediately.
3. Look for a message box containing **"Wordpress Admin Password"**.
4. **Copy and save this password!** It will only be shown once.

The default **Username** is `admin` (unless changed in configuration).

### Database & Config

- A `wp-config.php` file is automatically generated and maintained by the app.
- The database connection is handled automatically.

## ⚙️ Configuration
