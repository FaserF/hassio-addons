# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Vaultwarden (Bitwarden) (Custom)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Please prefer the official Vaultwarden add-on.**
> This add-on exists because Vaultwarden updates sometimes appear very slowly in the official repository.
> In this repository, updates are automatically triggered via Renovate, and if all CI tests pass, a new release is automatically published.
