## Advanced Configuration

The add-on comes pre-configured for standard usage. However, you can modify environment variables if needed.

### Database

The add-on includes an internal PostgreSQL instance. Data is persisted in `/data`.

### Custom Backgrounds

Upload your background images/videos to `/share/er-dashboard/uploads` (if configured to map there) or use the Web UI to upload.
