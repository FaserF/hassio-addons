🎉 **Happy New Year 2026!** 🎉

### 🎉 Major Release - Unified Addon Update

All add-ons have been unified, updated, and many bugs have been fixed. Many add-ons have been partially or completely rewritten to improve stability, performance, and maintainability.

#### Important Information

- **Edge Branch (Beta)**: A new `edge` branch is now available for those who want to test the latest features and improvements before they are released to the stable channel.
- **Unsupported Branch**: A new `unsupported` branch has been created for add-ons that no longer receive direct manual support. These add-ons are still maintained but may have limited support compared to the main add-ons.
- **Bug Reports**: If you encounter any new issues, please report them on GitHub as usual. Your feedback helps us improve the add-ons.

This release represents a significant effort to standardize and improve all add-ons in the repository.
