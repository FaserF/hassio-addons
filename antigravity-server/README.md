## ⚠️ Requirements

> **Architecture**: This add-on only supports **amd64** systems.
> ARM devices (Raspberry Pi, etc.) are not supported by the upstream project.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Add this repository to your **Home Assistant Add-on Store**.
1. Install the **Antigravity-Server** add-on.
1. Review the **Configuration** options below.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Click **"OPEN WEB UI"** to launch the desktop interface.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configure the add-on via the **Configuration** tab in the Home Assistant add-on page.

### Options

```yaml
log_level: info
vnc_password: ''
```

#### Option: `vnc_password` (Optional)

Set a custom VNC password (max 8 characters).

**If left empty (Default):**
*   A secure random password is generated on the first start.
*   **Storage**: Saved in `/data/vnc_password` to ensure it stays the same across restarts (Persistent).
*   **Visibility**: Printed prominently in the Add-on logs so you can copy it.

#### Option: `log_level` (Optional)

Controls the level of log output.

## 🔒 Security & Limitations

### Root Execution & `--no-sandbox`

This add-on currently runs the desktop session and the Antigravity IDE as the **root** user.
*   **Implication**: Electron-based applications (including Antigravity) require the `--no-sandbox` flag to run as root. This disables the Chrome sandbox security layer.
*   **Risk**: If the IDE is compromised, an attacker could theoretically gain root access to the **container** (though not necessarily the host, due to Docker/Supervisor isolation).
*   **Mitigation**: Avoid browsing untrusted malicious websites within the embedded browser if possible.

## ❓ Troubleshooting & Known Issues

During startup, you may see the following warnings in the logs. These are **normal** and expected behavior:

*   `/usr/bin/xauth: file /root/.Xauthority does not exist`
    *   Occurs on the first run when the VNC authority file is being generated.
*   `Warning: could not find self.pem` (from websockify)
    *   Occurs because the container uses HTTP internally, while Home Assistant Ingress handles the SSL encryption externally.
