## ❤️ Support This Project

> I maintain all these add-ons in my **free time alongside a regular job**. Test devices cost money, and every donation helps me stay independent and invest more time into open-source work.
>
> Donations are completely voluntary — but the more support I receive, the less I depend on other income and the more time I can dedicate to these projects.
