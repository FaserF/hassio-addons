Rocket.Chat Server for Homeassistant OS

## About

The OpenSource communication platform.<br /> 
Keep the workflow going by centralizing all your tools and touchpoints in one platform. Made for team collaboration, DevOps and customer engagement.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other custom Home Assistant add-on.<br /> 
Just add my repo to the hassio addons repositorys: https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons

## Ingress

This addon supports Homeassistant Ingress. But it seems to be buggy.
